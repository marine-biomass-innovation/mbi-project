The Marine Biomass Innovation (MBI) project is a multi-year transdisciplinary research project working to develop sustainable marine based entrepreneurship for local industries and community-based organizations through repurposing of marine biomass in Newfoundland, Canada.

## What is Biomass? 

For MBI, biomass refers to material that comes from the natural world or from a process that humans use to transform that material. We are particularly interested in biomass from the ocean or marine processes, like fish species, aquatic plants, or materials that connect the ocean with the land. We are interested in both primary biomass materials (e.g. an entire fish) and material left over after processing (e.g. fish skin, shrimp shells, etc.). As we investigate the potential for innovation using these marine biomass sources, we will carefully consider not only their economic value but also their cultural, spiritual, ecological, and social value in evaluating potential opportunities.   

## Problem 

Historically, marine industries have been key economic drivers in coastal, remote, and rural regions. However, communities in such regions are often left ill-equipped to achieve the full benefit of ocean-based economic opportunities emerging from innovative technology because of capacity issues, lack of capital to invest, outmigration of youth or skilled workers, among other factors. The lack of full and efficient utilization of marine biomass is unsustainable. We recognize that cultural sustainability and healthy populations are integral to resilient rural regions and that eco-innovation is key to the economic resilience of these communities.    

## Solution 

In partnership with coastal, rural and Mi’kmaw communities across three regions on the western portion of the island of Newfoundland (Bay St. George, Bay of Islands, and Great Northern Peninsula), we seek to collaborate and co-develop sustainable, innovative, marine-based entrepreneurship opportunities and technologies for local industries and community-based organizations. We will work in partnership with community partners and industry partners to develop innovative products that are sustainable, globally competitive, and economically and technically feasible.  

## Innovation 

The MBI Project is guided by [Etuaptmumk](https://mbiproject.ca/etuaptmumk/) (Two-Eyed Seeing). Etuaptmumk refers to learning to see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledge and ways of knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths of Western knowledge and ways of knowing and learning to use both eyes for the benefit of all. The MBI Project brings together coastal, rural, and Mi’kmaw communities, academic researchers, and industry partners to employ a collaborative research approach.   

## Budget 

The total budget for the project is $15,891,023 over six years. The MBI project draws upon research supported by the Government of Canada’s New Frontiers in Research Fund (NFRF) and contributions from collaborators.

# Governance Structure

The MBI Project is guided by a governance plan. The governance plan describes the overall governance and decision-making process for the MBI Project and its team members, partners, participants, and other individuals and organizations related to the project. The project, and the governance plan, are guided by a multi-faceted, inclusive, participatory, multisectoral, and interdisciplinary approach to governance and project management.  

To ensure both effective communication across the team, and that the project remains focused on its goals and guiding frameworks, the project has a well-established management structure consisting of a Project Management Committee (PMC), Administration Leadership Team (ALT), Monitoring and Evaluation Advisory Committee (MEAC), three Regional Community Advisory Committees (RCAC), and eight Work Package Teams (WPTs).

The project partners are at the core of the project’s management structure. This includes representatives from industry, Mi’kmaq, and other community partners and stakeholders. Additional individuals and entities who may not be officially linked to the project, such as government representatives, entrepreneurs, and others, will be invited to join the MEAC and RCACs. This will add to the project’s capacity, as well as the impact of its outcomes among an extensive network of regional stakeholders.  

A strong relationship of collaboration will also be required within and between the different WPTs since data and materials will inform subsequent WPT research in reciprocal ways. An online yearly meeting (or in-person when possible) of all committees and teams will be held to facilitate integration and monitor progress. Additional full team meetings, including partners, will be held as needed.
