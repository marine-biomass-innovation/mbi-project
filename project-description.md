title: About the Marine Biomass Innovation Project

<h2>What is Biomass?</h2>
For the MBI project, biomass refers to material that comes from the natural world or from a process that humans use to transform that material. We are particularly interested in biomass coming from the ocean or marine processes, like fish species, aquatic plants, or materials that connect the ocean with the land. We are interested in both primary biomass materials (for example, an entire fish) and material that is left over after processing (fish skin, shrimp shells, etc.). As we investigate the potential for innovation using these marine biomass sources, we will carefully consider not only their economic value, but also their cultural, spiritual, and social value in evaluating potential opportunities.

<h2>Problem</h2>
Historically, marine industries have been key economic drivers in coastal, remote, and rural regions. However, communities in such regions are often ill-equipped to achieve the full benefit of ocean- based economic opportunities emerging from innovative scientific technology and the demand for novel marine products due to factors such as lack of capacity and capital to invest. Many of these communities are also challenged with outmigration of youth or skilled workers, low participation rates in entrepreneurship opportunities, food or nutrient insecurity, and high incidences of chronic diseases. Lack of full and efficient utilization of marine biomass is also ecologically unsustainable.

<h2>Solution</h2>
In partnership with coastal rural and Mi’kmaq Communities across three regions on the Western portion of the Island of Newfoundland (Bay St. George, Bay of Islands, and Northern Peninsula), we seek to collaborate and co-develop sustainable, innovative, marine based entrepreneurship opportunities and technologies for local industries and community-based organizations. We will work in partnership with community partners and enterprises to develop products that are sustainable, globally competitive, economically, and technically feasible with existing local infrastructure.

<h2>Innovation</h2>
This is a unique inter-disciplinary project that brings together Mi’kmaw and non-Indigenous communities, academic partners, enterprises, and stakeholders, and employs a collaborative research approach that integrates natural sciences with social sciences and “Western” or scientific knowledge systems with equal validation and inclusion of Mi’kmaw knowledge systems. Through Two-Eyed Seeing, a Mi’kmaw conceptual framework for research coined by Elder Albert Marshall, this research aims to recognize and validate Mi’kmaw knowledge systems alongside Western scientific investigation. We recognize that cultural sustainability and healthy populations are integral to resilient rural regions and that eco-innovation is key to the economic resilience of these communities.
