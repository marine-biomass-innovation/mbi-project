# Indigenous Community Partners
Invaluable to their local communities, Mi'kmaw community partners are at the core the the MBI Project. Etuaptmumk is founded on the principal that all ways of knowing are coexistant. Following Etuaptmumk is to practice and show that respect, relationship, reverence, reciprocity, ritual, repetition and responsibility can, and should, exist alongside the scientific method (hypothesis), data collection, and testing, model theory and construction. Colloboration, inclusion and sharing with community partners ensures accountibility of the MBI project research team to practice Etuaptmumk and to good in the local communities the project is working in.

## Bay St. George

> **Indigenous Community Liaison:** Nina Tourett-Retieffe

Bay St. George is a unique area on the southwest corner of Newfoundland, with vibrant Mi'kmaw communities surrounding the ocean and a picturesque landscape nearly as beautiful as its people. The long rich history of Mi'kmaw use and occupancy of Newfoundland starts in Bay St. George. This portion of the island was visible, and navigable by the sea in ocean-going canoes, from Cape Breton.

### [Flat Bay Band](http://flatbayband.ca/)

> **Flat Bay Band Chief:** Chief Joanne Miles

Flat Bay Band/No'kmaq Village is a non-profit village council encompassing the Mi’kmaw communities of Flat Bay East, West & St. Teresa. The Band is over 50 years old and is the oldest surviving band in the province outside of the Miawpukek First Nation, which Flat Bay helped form. Historically, Flat Bay Mi’kmaq managed their community affairs through a process whereby the most senior and knowledgeable person would take charge of dealing with the resolution process; this remains the case to this day. Flat Bay is the only community in Canada that self-governs without a government budget or municipal support such as a town council, or local service district. For the past 50 years, Flat Bay has avoided colonial-style government, where policies are developed, passed down, and imposed on the people. The unique system originates from the Mi'kmaw of Flat Bay and is carried out by the Band Council. 

Duly elected by the democratic process in June 1971, and incorporated in 1974, Flat Bay Band is a highly credible, incorporated body in good standing, free of litigation, and without a single encounter with funding agents. The Flat Bay Band has contributed to many of the key advancements throughout the decades in forging recognition for Mi'kmaq in Newfoundland.  

The Flat Bay Band mission is to maintain a self-governance structure, to deliver social development, environmental heritage, wellness, and community economic initiatives, and to preserve Mi’kmaw culture by restoring identity, encouraging pride, and unity, and supporting spiritual and artistic expression.

### [Benoit First Nation](http://www.benoitfirstnation.ca/) 

> **Benoit First Nation Chief:** Chief Jasen Benwah

Benoit First Nation is a L’nui’suti Regional Cultural and Language Band. Benoit First Nation was established in 2005 to revive the original Port au Port Indian Band from the 1970s under a new name. The Band provides regional and local Lnu'k/Mi'kmaq programming and activities in culture, language, traditions, and more. Benoit First Nation works to strengthen their community and educate their children, exposing them to the true Mi'kmaw history of the region. The Band also works to provide Elder support and food security for vulnerable households. Although supportive of regional cooperation, involvement, interaction, communication, sharing, and partnerships, Benoit First Nation is an independent regional Lnu'k/Mi'kmaq Community.  

Since time immemorial, Lnu'k/Mi'kmaq have had a prominent presence in St. George's Bay (Nujio'qoniik) and on Payun Aqq Payunji'j (the Port au Port Peninsula). Many Lnu'k/Mi'kmaq ancestors came from around Pitu'pa'q (Bras d'Or lakes) in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Currently, many distant relatives of Benoit First Nation members continue to live on Reserves there. The Mi'kmaq of Benoit First Nation peacefully co-existed with the Red Ochre people (Beothuk), and through intermarriage, have many connections between the two.  

As a result of being penciled out of the 1949 Confederation with Canada along with all other Indigenous Groups in Newfoundland and Labrador, the Lnu'k/Mi'kmaq were not registered and without official rights. Since then, the Indigenous Peoples of Newfoundland and Labrador have come together to protect their rights and heritage.

### St. George’s Band

> **St. George's Band Chief:** Chief Rhonda Sheppard 

The St. George’s Indian Band is a non-profit Mi’kmaq organization established in 1989 and incorporated in 2003. The Band is comprised of a Chief, Vice-Chief, secretary, treasurer, four directors, an Elder, and a youth representative who are elected in a democratic process every four years. As a First Nation’s Band Council, the St. George’s Indian Band strives to promote cultural awareness and a sense of pride in Mi’kmaq heritage. Band priorities include education, health, economic development, improved housing, cultural enhancement, tourism, and recreation.  

The community of St. George’s is an area rich in Mi’kmaw history. The earliest occupation of the area is uncertain, however, the area known as Seal Rocks which is now a part of the community of St. George’s is well documented as being the largest and principal Mi’kmaq settlement in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. St. George's was established in 1804 as the first permanent settlement of Mi’kmaq People in Newfoundland for the resettlement of the Mi’kmaq of Nova Scotia. Mi’kmaq oral tradition maintains that the Mi’kmaq occupation of the area is ancient.  

The Band currently represents approximately 1700 members inside the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, with another 500 outside of the province. St. George's Band's spiritual grounds are located in different areas throughout Bay St. George including Steel Mountain, Mendueuge (Devil’s Place), Calvary Hill, Hell’s Gulch, Hungry Grove, Seal Rocks, Molly Ann’s Cove, and the Mouth of Barachois.

The Band strives to provide food hampers for seniors, do wellness checks, purchase computers for kids, help people navigate paperwork they may need to complete, and participate in drives to provide food for members at no cost. The Band has opened a trading post, which includes a convenience store, a gas station, and a used clothing store. Those enterprises have employed people and provided them with reasons to stay in the area.

### Elmastukwek First Nation (Benoit's Cove Indian Band)

> **Elmastukwek First Nation Chief:** Chief Terri Greene

The Benoit’s Cove Indian Band is one of the original Bands under the Federation of Indians (FNI). In recent years the Band has been known as Elmastukwek(Bay of Islands) First Nation. The Band is located on the West Coast of Newfoundland on the southern shore of the Bay of Islands, extending from Halfway Point to Lark Harbour. The Band consists of both status and self-identifying members living inside or originally from the Band’s boundaries with a bloodline connection to the Band.

Over the last 10 years the local band wasn’t active causing a loss of sense of identity and recognition as a historical Indigenous community. A new generation of Indigenous community members took on the task of reviving the once thriving Band to bring back gatherings and teachings to the local communities to restore our ways of life.

The mandate of the Band is to promote social, cultural, and economic development of the membership. The Band is committed to the restoration and preservation of their traditional ways, and to protecting Mother Earth as guided by the seven sacred teachings: Wisdom, Honesty, Respect, Bravery, Truth, Humility and Love. Consistent with the commitment to restoring and preserving its traditions and protecting Mother Earth, it has sought and participated in several different activities to meet these objectives.
