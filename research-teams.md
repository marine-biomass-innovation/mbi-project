The MBI project is highly collaborative with research partners around the world. The researchers on this project are split across eight 'work packages', each with their own focus, goals and methodologies.

## Work Package Teams

### Work Package 1: Socio-economic and community development context for product innovation
Work package 1 is working on the assessment of the socio-economic and community development context for product innovation. The purpose of this work package is to develop an understanding of the economic and cultural histories of coastal communities, especially in relation to fish waste. It is led by Kelly Vodden (Memorial University in Newfoundland, Canada) and Heather Hall (University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada).


### Work Package 2: Green processing
In the overall goal is to develop innovative processing approaches for extracting value from marine raw materials which can help to create economic and entrepreneurial opportunities for the project regions. Shellfish (e.g., crab, mussels, shrimp) and finfish processing by-products (i.e., guts, trimmings, bones, shell), sea cucumber, and seaweed are the primary feedstocks being considered. Existing processes which can extract high value compounds from such materials are limited to lab scale, use toxic chemicals or aggressive operating conditions, and/or are not appropriate for remote and rural locations. We have two overarching objectives; 
1) Develop innovative ‘green’ processes that can extract or convert fish processing by-products and raw materials - primarily feedstocks identified by work packages 3-5 into value added secondary products ranging from nutraceuticals to biomaterials. 
2) Act as a resource for processors and regions to build a sustainable fishery and export knowledge and processes created nationally and internationally. 

This work package team is led by Kelly Hawboldt (Memorial University in Newfoundland, Canada).

### Work Package 3: Assessment of marine-derived raw material and products for nutritional and functional ingredients
Research conducted by this work package seeks to assess the quality and safety of marine-derived materials using a multimodal metabolomic approach. Various analytical techniques will be employed, including molecular genetics, vibrational spectroscopy, chromatography, and mass spectrometry. Results obtained are expected to provide insight into marine-derived materials’ spatial, qualitative and quantitative composition. Such insight will facilitate targeted product development for applications, including functional foods, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, and biofertilizers.

This work package team is led by Raymond Thomas (Memorial University in Newfoundland Canada).

### Work Package 4: Formulation and evaluation of novel functional foods, biomaterials, nano-fertilizers and aquaculture feed
The goals will be to investigate the development, formulation and testing of functional foods, biomaterials and nano-biofertilizers from the extracts and waste/residues. 

This work package team is led by Mumtaz Cheema (Memorial University in Newfoundland Canada) and Lord Abbey (Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada).

### Work Package 5: Health benefits of isolates, functional foods and nutraceuticals from marine products
The purpose and goals of work package 5 are to assess the health benefits of raw materials, novel extracts, and other bioactives from marine biomass. Targeted diseases are: diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, cancer, brain health, inflammation, cell-cycle regulation, and other related metabolic disorders. In-vitro cell culture models will be used for rapid screening of extracts / isolates / bioactives for their potential health benefits. Marine isolates and bioactives showing potential for health benefits will then be tested in animal models to establish dose, duration, sex-specific effects, safety, efficacy, and toxicity. Specialized techniques (bioluminescence imaging) will be used to study brain function. Furthermore, the health benefits of developed functional foods and nutraceuticals will be confirmed in specific animal models. Human clinical trials will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of existing and/or newly developed functional foods and nutraceticals to bring niche products to market. Data generated will be shared with other work packages to ensure the informatics database developed by the consortium is comprehensive, useful and translational to project-partners and industry. In collaboration with community and industry partners, novel products will be launched to improve population and community health, particularly in rural, coastal and Indigenous communities.

This work package is led by Sukinder Cheema (Memorial University in Newfoundland Canada).

### Work Package 6: Advance sustainable coastal entrepreneurship & economic development opportunities
Advancement of opportunities through:
1) governance structure and ongoing engagement processes to facilitate co-construction of knowledge; 
2) integrate findings to assess their socio-economic potential and community interest/acceptance for foundation of pilot commercialization; 
3) evaluate the process/incorporate capacity building.

This work package is lead by Billy Newell (Memorial University in Newfoundland, Canada).

### Work Package 7: Knowledge mobilization and Impact Assessment
Work package 7 will interconnect other work packages in this proposal, following Memorial University’s public engagement model which upholds that engagement is built on mutual contribution, is based on mutual respect, and ought to generate mutual benefit.

This work package is lead by Mery Perez and Ken Carter at Memorial University in Newfoundland, Canada.

### Work Package 8: Data Management, analysis and informatics
Work package 8 will establish a data management system for the project such that data generated by all research teams are consolidated for integration and collaboration between teams. The team aims to help in the understanding of the relationships between the data collected across the various disciplines and support other work packages to make more informed coordinated project decisions. There are two main objectives:
1) Develop analysis pipeline systems capable of holding and analysing databases created across all work packages and sites.
2) Develop multivariate analysis solutions to assess the value of marine products.

This work package is led by Jimmy Breen (Australian National University/Telethon Kids Institute in Australia) and Flavia Esposito (University of Bari Aldo Moro in Bari, Italy). 

For the analysis, Uniba (Italy) will take advantage of established workflows by their work group by using computational techniques such as Exploratory Data Analysis, Dimensionality Reductions, Clustering, and supervised approaches. The appropriate methodology will be asses taking into account: 
i) preliminary assumptions of the marine domain also provided by other WPTs as well Indigenous communities, 
ii) computational and interpretable performances (such as goodness, robustness, or scalability of the proposed methodology, 
iii) structure of data under study and 
iv) their ability to link biological systems and industrial scenarios
