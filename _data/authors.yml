TaraCashen:
  name:              Tara Cashen
  email:             tscashen@grenfell.mun.ca
  about:             Tara Cashen (she/her) is of settler, both colonial and newcomer, ancestry with reverence for, and more connection work to do with, her ancestors. Tara’s most impactful teachings and relations come from Sipekne'katik Mi’kmak’i and have prompted her to seek placefulness during her time in the Bay of Islands. In all facets of life, Tara seeks thoughtful and pragmatic design that meets our human needs while regenerating the lands and waters on which we depend, creatively adapting to the changes we typically fear. This sense of responsibility finds deep embrace for the Mi’kmaq principles of Etuaptmumk and Netukulimk, grounding and fortifying her studies with land-based teachings and earth-honouring traditions.
